! Define the input boundary points via INBND_COUNT_NML and
!                                      INBND_POINT_NML namelist
! - for RECT, CURV and UNST grids -
!
! * If no mask defined, INBOUND can be used
!
! * If the actual input data is not defined in the actual wave model run
!   the initial conditions will be applied as constant boundary conditions.
!
! * The number of points is defined by INBND_COUNT
!
! * The points must start from index 1 to N
!
! * Each line contains:
!     Discrete grid counters (IX,IY) of the active point and a
!     connect flag. If this flag is true, and the present and previous
!     point are on a grid line or diagonal, all intermediate points
!     are also defined as boundary points.
!
! * Included point :
!     grid points from segment data
!     Defines as lines identifying points at which
!     input boundary conditions are to be defined. 
!
! * namelist must be terminated with /
! * definitions & defaults:
!     INBND_COUNT%N_POINT     = 0        ! number of segments
!
!     INBND_POINT(I)%X_INDEX  = 0        ! x index included point
