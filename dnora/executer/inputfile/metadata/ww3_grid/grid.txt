! Define the grid to preprocess via GRID_NML namelist
!
! * the tunable parameters for source terms, propagation schemes, and 
!    numerics are read using namelists. 
! * Any namelist found in the folowing sections is temporarily written
!   to param.scratch, and read from there if necessary. 
! * The order of the namelists is immaterial.
! * Namelists not needed for the given switch settings will be skipped
!   automatically
!
! * grid type can be : 
!    'RECT' : rectilinear
!    'CURV' : curvilinear
!    'UNST' : unstructured (triangle-based)
!
! * coordinate system can be : 
!    'SPHE' : Spherical (degrees)
!    'CART' : Cartesian (meters)
!
! * grid closure can only be applied in spherical coordinates
!
! * grid closure can be : 
!    'NONE' : No closure is applied
!    'SMPL' : Simple grid closure. Grid is periodic in the
!           : i-index and wraps at i=NX+1. In other words,
!           : (NX+1,J) => (1,J). A grid with simple closure
!           : may be rectilinear or curvilinear.
!    'TRPL' : Tripole grid closure : Grid is periodic in the
!           : i-index and wraps at i=NX+1 and has closure at
!           : j=NY+1. In other words, (NX+1,J<=NY) => (1,J)
!           : and (I,NY+1) => (NX-I+1,NY). Tripole
!           : grid closure requires that NX be even. A grid
!           : with tripole closure must be curvilinear.
!
! * The coastline limit depth is the value which distinguish the sea 
!   points to the land points. All the points with depth values (ZBIN)
!   greater than this limit (ZLIM) will be considered as excluded points
!   and will never be wet points, even if the water level grows over.
!   It can only overwrite the status of a sea point to a land point.
!   The value must have a negative value under the mean sea level
!
! * The minimum water depth allowed to compute the model is the absolute
!   depth value (DMIN) used in the model if the input depth is lower to 
!   avoid the model to blow up.
!
! * namelist must be terminated with /
! * definitions & defaults:
!     GRID%NAME             = 'unset'            ! grid name (30 char)
!     GRID%NML              = 'namelists.nml'    ! namelists filename
!     GRID%TYPE             = 'unset'            ! grid type
!     GRID%COORD            = 'unset'            ! coordinate system
!     GRID%CLOS             = 'unset'            ! grid closure
!
!     GRID%ZLIM             = 0.        ! coastline limit depth (m)
!     GRID%DMIN             = 0.        ! abs. minimum water depth (m)
